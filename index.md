Dr. David Livingstone was Africa's most well-known missionary. He explored areas of Africa that no one else would go to. He gained great fame, but his mission dropped him. His main goal was to stop slavery, and while slavery still existed for his lifetime, afterwards, slavery was abolished in most coutnries around the world.

Dr. Livingstone has a very inspiring story, especially for those interested in becoming missionaries but do not have the financial support. His testimony truly shows Matthew 21:22. He even was able to continue after he lost support! God will truly provide for us as He did for Dr. Livingstone in Africa.

Dr. Livingstone had a very eventful life, from [growing up poor and working in a cotton mill]({% post_url 2025-01-22-the-birth-of-a-hero %}) to [having a journalist track him down in the jungle]({% post_url 2025-01-30-dr-livingstone-i-presume %}). These events make a very enjoyable story, whether you read it from start to finish or just read parts of it. Even the most boring parts of his life can be made into a great story!

His story can be read in the form of [posts on this website]({{ "posts" | relative_url }}). I pray that God will use his story to inspire and encourage you.
