Henry Morton Stanley was born in 1841 in Wales. He did various different things throughout his life. He spent most of his youth in a workhouse for orphans, then sailed as a cabin boy on a ship to New Orleans at the age of 17. He joined the Confederate Army during the American Civil War, and was soon captured. He joined the Union Army to get out of prison, but the discharged him because of poor health. Soon after, he joined the Union Navy, but deserted a year later and became a newspaper reporter.

Europe and America had no idea where Dr. Livingstone was, so the *London Daily Telegraph* and the *New York Herald* sent Henry Stanley to search for him. Stanley went on an expedition of his own, which he wrote about in his best-selling book, *How I Found Livingstone*, published in 1872.

Dr. Livingstone had just made it to Ujiji, with no money and nothing to trade for food. He was in despair. A freed slave named Susi, which helped him get to Ujiji, saw Stanley. When Stanley first met Livingstone, he said, “Dr. Livingstone, I presume?” Stanley had brought enough food and medicine to restore Livingstone’s health. Livingstone and Stanley traveled together to get to a major trading center 300 miles away. Livingstone hired porters there to assist him, and Stanley returned to the coast.
