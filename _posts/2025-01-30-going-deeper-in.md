Dr. Livingstone’s final goal was not to stay at Dr. Philips’ mission at Cape Town, but to see the “real” Africa. To be able to minister to those deeper in, he continued to his original goal of making it to Dr. Moffat’s mission in Kuruman. To do so, he needed to go on a three-month wagon ride. They packed all of the essentials and food that they would need for three months, and started the journey. Since the wagon was so heavy, they required twelve oxen to pull it. They hired three natives to guide them and to drive the oxen.

They finally arrived, but Dr. Livingstone didn’t stay long. A couple years later, he chose to go further north and establish another mission station. He wanted to “preach the gospel beyond every other man’s line of things.” This new station was 250 miles north of Kuruman at Mabotsa.

At this new station, he was attacked by a lion. His survival was an absolute miracle, since his left shoulder was broken in several places, causing him to never be able to fully use his left arm again. To recover, he returned south to the station in Kuruman. While at the station, he would marry Dr. Moffat’s daughter Mary.

He returned to Mabotsa with his new wife, but chose soon after to leave to explore. He made it to a place 40 miles to the north, then to Kolobeng, which is on the eastern edge of the Kalahari Desert. Within a couple years, he became restless again and wanted to keep exploring more.
