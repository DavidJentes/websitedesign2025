Dr. Livingstone’s yearning for exploration eventually led to a great expedition north of the Kalahari Desert. He had two reasons for this expedition. He wanted to see Lake Ngami (pictured above), which he would be the first European to see, and minitster to the Makololo people, which lived just north of the lake.

Livingstone would not make this journey alone. He had help from two supporters, one named WIlliam Colton Oswell, a wealthy young big-game hunter, and the other being his friend Mungo Murray. They were guided by an African named Ramotobi. It consisted of 80 oxen, 20 horses, and 30 to 40 porters and drivers.

There were many dangers on this trip. Water was scarce, and the only reason they had any water at all was because of Ramotobi’s knowledge of how to dig for it. Many scorpions could be found along the route, which induced severe pain and paralysis, and the cures, like searing with a hot iron, were usually as bad as the bite.

They frequently saw mirages, being tricked into thinking they were close the Lake Ngami. At one point, even Ramotobi got lost. However, they found a river, at the time called the Zouga, now called the Botletle. The local people confirmed that it led to the lake, so they followed it for 280 miles, and reached the lake on August 1.

The Maololo lived another 200 miles to the north. The local ruler refused to give them a guide since they were European, so they chose to return back to the station.
