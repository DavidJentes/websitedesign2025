David Livingstone was born on March 19, 1813, the second son of Neil and Agnes Livingstone of Blantyre, Scotland. His family was very poor, meaning that he had to work at a cotton mill starting at age ten. Before he began, however, he began his pursuit for knowledge.

Despite being from a poor family, he had a great mind and was able to read. He read many books, sometimes staying up so late that his grandmother would have to blow out the candle for him to make him go to sleep. His favorite book was his Bible. A new foreman confronted David at the cotton mill, and could not believe that he won such a nice Bible. To do so, David had to memorize all 176 verses of Psalm 119, and he proved himself right in front of the foreman. David was also committed to his studies. He went to a Latin class with the schoolmaster after work for two hours, studying Latin any chance he got, even at work.

Around 19 years of age, he read a book by Dr. Thomas Dick. He wrote a philosophy book on how the Bible and science were compatible. David, confused because of contradictions between the Bible and science, decided to ask Dr. Dick himself about these matters, as he was also a Scotsman. He walked almost the entire width of Scotland from Blantyre to Broughty Ferry to talk to him. Dr. Dick said that some scientific observations are false because men are imperfect, showing David why those contradictions seem to exist.

After he returned, he chose to leave the Church of Scotland in favor of an independent church three miles from home. At this church, he would learn not only about having a personal relationship with Christ and His death for our salvation, but also of the need for medical missionaries in China. Despite being poor, he was determined to study to become a missionary, originally planning to go to China. He studied Greek, theology, medicine, and chemistry at three different institutions. He studied Greek at Glasgow University, Theology at Congregational College, and medicine and chemistry at Anderson College. He graduated with a medical degree and was ready to enter the mission field.
