While David Livingstone wanted to be a missionary, he needed financial support to be able to go to China. He chose to apply to the London Missionary Society, which had a few qualifications. He needed to be proficient in Latin, Greek, and theology before they would consider him. Most important of all, he needed to be able to preach a sermon.

David was given three months of probation to work on a sermon and these qualifications. When he had finished, he was asked to preach the evening service at a church with a prepared sermon that he had memorized. When he was at the pulpit, he greeted the congregation, then forgot how the sermon began!

David was obviously embarrassed by this, so he left the chapel and went back to his room. He realized that he needed to trust God, and for some reason, He did not want him to speak today. Because of this, as well as a health condition that affected his voice, the reverend in charge of recommending him to the Missionary Society said that he cannot.

However, hope was not lost. David would get a second chance to become a missionary with the Society. However, he realized the monumental task it would be to convince the Missionary Society to send him to China instead of some other country. What he wouldn’t realize is that sending him to another country was God’s will.
