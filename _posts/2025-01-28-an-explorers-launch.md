David Livingstone appreciated his second chance, and used it wisely. He continued in his studies, and even worked in a hospital for a few weeks. While he wanted to go to China, he was instead picked to be sent to South Africa. Once he got his physician’s license, he said goodbye to family and left for Africa.

He sailed on the *George*, accompanied by William Ross, one of his fellow students. The captain of the ship was not a Christian, so David led Sunday services on the ship instead. He spent as much time off of the ship as he could, as it had to stop occasionally to make repairs. While ashore, he handed tracts to drunk seamen.

Livingstone and Ross soon arrived in Africa. They were asked to stay at a station nearer to the shore, operated by Dr. Philips. Philips said that he was aiming to dominate Dr. Moffat’s mission, which was the mission that Livingstone was aiming for. Dr. Philips aimed to also stop slavery, but Dr. Moffat was opposed to the matter, saying that Philips was too political and that they should merely share the gospel instead of trying to stop slavery.
