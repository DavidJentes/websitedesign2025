As quoted from the 1965 Encyclopedia Britannica:

"[David Livingstone] was the greatest explorer-missionary in Africa of the 19th century. He was responsible not only for opening up the southern half of that continent but also for disclosing to the civilized world what he called 'the running sore of Africa,' the slave trade, as practised in the interior."
